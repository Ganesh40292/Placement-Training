At precisely 3:07 a.m., when the sky outside looked like a soggy napkin someone had used to wipe away cosmic disappointment, my ceiling fan began spinning backward with the kind of vindictive enthusiasm normally reserved for raccoons denied access to unsecured garbage, and as it rotated it made a faint whispering sound that suspiciously resembled the phrase “your kneecaps are on probation,” which was rude because I have been nothing but respectful to my joints; meanwhile, the microwave clicked on by itself even though it wasn’t plugged in, which was particularly concerning because all I had stored inside was a single slice of cold pizza that had been there long enough to establish squatter’s rights, and as the turntable slowly circled, the pizza slice hummed a low tune reminiscent of a depressed foghorn practicing yoga breathing, and I could feel the air pressure change in the room like the universe was quietly adjusting its pants; then the refrigerator began vibrating as though it were trying to recall traumatic memories involving expired yogurt, and its magnets rearranged themselves into the sentence “stop ignoring the hallway,” which felt excessively ominous considering the hallway had never done anything except exist threateningly, yet when I glanced toward it, I noticed it had grown longer by at least five mysterious feet, each of which smelled faintly of regret, cinnamon, and possibly wet socks; speaking of socks, mine were no longer on my feet but had somehow climbed to the ceiling, hanging there like deflated bats contemplating whether gravity was merely a suggestion, and every time I blinked they scooted a little farther across the plaster, leaving behind streaks of something I sincerely hoped was symbolic rather than biological; the houseplants, which I distinctly remembered arranging in a peaceful cluster, had reorganized themselves into a semicircle facing me with unsettling deliberation, rustling in a way that suggested they were discussing my performance review as a human being, and one of the ferns kept leaning slightly forward like it was trying to signal that I had broccoli stuck in my teeth, which I didn’t, because I hadn’t eaten broccoli in three days; then the lightbulb above flickered aggressively, spelling out “oops” in Morse code, which is never what you want your lighting to confess, and at that exact moment the floorboards beneath me let out a long, theatrical sigh as though they were tired of supporting my emotional baggage; suddenly, a draft drifted through the living room even though the windows were not open, and within that draft floated a single tumbleweed which rolled to a stop at my feet, coughed politely, then exhaled a puff of glitter that smelled faintly of burnt hopes, and I had just begun to process this when my phone buzzed with a notification from an app I had never installed called Cryptic Bone Weather, warning me that the clavicle pressure index was “uncourtly” today, which made no sense but somehow still felt personally accusatory; the dishwasher began clicking rhythmically like castanets performing a cursed tango, and the sink started giggling in that unsettling way sinks do when they know something you don’t, and I swear the faucet rotated toward me like a disapproving parent preparing a lecture about my life choices; the wallpaper peeled itself into the shape of a mildly disappointed Victorian man who muttered something about my posture, and although I tried to ignore him, he kept adjusting his imaginary monocle every time I slouched; meanwhile, the TV, which had been off, flickered to life and showed me a loading screen containing only the phrase “fetching consequences,” which I felt was unnecessary because I had specifically gone the entire day without summoning any eldritch debt collectors; then the carpet beneath my feet began rippling like gelatin having an existential crisis, and from its depths emerged a lone sock glowing with an aura of cryptic authority, and it whispered, “You dropped this,” before biting my ankle and retreating into the floor as though it had never existed; even worse, the pizza inside the microwave had grown a tiny face—not a horrific face, just vaguely disappointed, like a barista who’s been told you want your latte at exactly 147 degrees—and it politely informed me that I should really stop pretending the hallway wasn’t lengthening, which was fair because it had now developed a slight curve, gently bending toward a point that definitely hadn’t been part of the house yesterday; the Bone Weather app buzzed again, warning that the cursed humidity level was reaching “churlish,” which I didn’t understand but deeply felt in my soul, especially as the ceiling fan accelerated to a speed that suggested it was preparing either for flight or emotional detachment; the tumbleweed coughed a second time, wheezed, rolled in a tiny circle like it was rebooting, then spat out a small paper slip that read “don’t trust the toaster,” which was laughably late advice because the toaster had already begun humming what sounded like a lullaby for burnt souls; and as all of this unfolded, the walls pulsed faintly as though the house itself were breathing, and the lightbulb, now flickering like a nervous rodent, flashed another Morse code warning that translated roughly to “brace yourself,” and honestly I would have braced if not for the sudden realization that my reflection in the darkened TV screen was waving at me with both hands, even though I was not waving back; at that moment I realized the situation had reached an unmistakable peak of cursedness, so I took a deep breath, considered every questionable decision that had led me to this moment, and concluded with absolute, bone-deep certainty that this was simply the natural consequence of living in a house held together entirely by spite, snacks, and whatever eldritch warranty expired decades before I moved in.
